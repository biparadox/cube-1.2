# Cube - 1.2

This is a dynamic cloud-to-end secure middleware.
I have already had a runnable version cube-1.11, but I am not very satisfied about it.So I am rewritting it, to let it throughoutly non-dependable, no lock, no ipc, need not interrupt others, and can run with all kinds of secure mechanism transparntly.
Perhaps I need 5 or 6 month to finish it, but believe me, it is worth you to wait.
